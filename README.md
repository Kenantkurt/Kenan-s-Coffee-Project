# Kenan's Coffee Project

A café management system for handling orders, tables, menu items, and inventory efficiently.

## Kenan Cafe Sales and Tax Analysis

For Kenan Cafe, products and prices were determined, and various mathematical calculations were performed for all four quarters of the year. These calculations included:

- Total items sold
- Total sales revenue
- Minimum and maximum sales values
- Average sales

A tax rate was established, and using a reference value assignment method, the tax for each product was calculated individually. All calculations were made in US dollars.

To improve readability and visual clarity, formatting such as cell colors, fonts, and headings was applied.

## Technologies
